# WSL-2: The warp drive for Windows developers

## Develop under Windows and compile in Unix

Have the development environment in Windows and code compiled under Ubuntu? No more problem with the Windows subsystem for Linux. Thanks to the UNIX file system, compiler times in Java projects can be cut in half. Thanks to the free Out of the Box solution from Microsoft and the Open Source Quick Start Guide presented, such an integration can be made possible within a very short time. The evaluated figures from the performance analysis will leave no developer's heart untouched.
